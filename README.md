# WW2 Rush

## Features:
The mission is the milestone of bringing Battlefield Rush game mode to ArmA3. As such, it has anything you would expect: 60 slots, vehicles, phase-lines, custom scenery, objectives to disarm/defuse, classes, perks, unlocks, progression, team-bonuses, kill-feeds and more! :zap:

Of course, as FPS, the first person is enforced to give it the Battlefield look and a custom GUI is also provided, to further enhance the user experience.  :bust_in_silhouette:

## Mission:
The teams are divided in two colors. Each time will play both attackers and defenders. Attackers are to destroy all (4) the enemy radio stations by arming them and blowing them up. Defenders are, as you'd expect, to defend their positions and prevent the attackers from destroying the objectives. Winners are awarded with extra points at the end of the round.

## Classes:
There are four classes that a player can chose from:
#### Field Medic:
This class can revive downed players almost instantly, avoiding them to respawn back at HQ or on beacons;
#### Assault:
This class can choose whether being able to deploy spawn beacons or being a grenadier, allowing it to carry frags, both AP and AT;
#### Engineer:
This class is specialized causing havoc! As engineer you can choose between being able to repair vehicles, carrying an AT rocket launcher or carrying AT mines that can be used to set up deadly ambushes;
#### Support:
This class is tasked with the duty of replenishing the allied units' ammo, both infantry and armor.

## Perks:
Each player can choose his own personal perks, together with his class specialization:
#### Sprint:
Allow the player to run 5% faster;
#### Extended Ammo:
Allow player to carry more ammo;
#### Smoke Grenades:
Gives player the ability to carry smokes for cover;
